# Titanic Data Analysis Project (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic disaster dataset. It covers the fundamental steps of data science: data cleaning, grouping, and visualization.

## Project Content & Analysis
The following analytical steps were implemented in this project:

* **Data Cleaning:** The `Cabin` column, which had a high density of missing values (687 missing entries), was removed from the dataset.
* **Class Analysis:** Distribution of passenger classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) and their survival rates were compared.
* **Gender Analysis:** Survival probabilities of male and female passengers were visualized and compared.
* **Children Analysis:** Passengers under the age of 18 were filtered to compare their survival rates against adults.
* **Advanced Analysis (Optional):** The impact of family size (`FamilySize`) and passenger titles (`Title`) on survival was explored.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3.12**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For matrix and numerical calculations.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization (Bar charts, Histograms).
